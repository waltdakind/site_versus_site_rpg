# Site VS Site RPG

Web analytics are typically delivered in charts and graphs, the purpose of this project is to turn web analytics data into a fun turn-based RPG where chosen sites become active characters in the game. To begin a player forms a party out of a collection of different sites (based on the type of site, the character formed from it will be assigned a different class with different abilities).

Site Vs Site RPG is a turn based RPG where the character stats are culled from real web site analytics data from Alexa Web Information Services' API
  - Uses Node and MySQL to store site/character data
  - Favicons from popular (and not so popular) sites form the basis for the player's in-game icon
  - Player class determined by type of web sites chosen as part of one's party

This project is a collaborative effort of Rutgers Coding Bootcamp participants Jacob Deming [@JacobDeming], Nate Hawley [@Nhawley], Walter Mattingly [@waltdakind], and John Reda [@johnreda].  A version of the site is available at [site-v-site](http://site-v-site.herokuapp.com)
 

 We hope you enjoy!
